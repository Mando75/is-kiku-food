        This is the first recorded mention of Kiku Rice. From our investigation,
        we have learned that Kiku Rice is a smol-grain rice which was
        specifically bred over many years to pair perfectly with scrumptious
        flavors of the Sea Bunny. Much like pairing fine wines with high-class
        entr√©es, we can be sure that Kiku will taste her best when rolled into a
        sushi packed with Kiku Rice.
